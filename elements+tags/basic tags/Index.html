<pre>HTML, or HyperText Markup Language is the standard markup language used to create web pages. It is a combination of Hypertext and Markup language. The Hypertext defines the link between web pages, and Markup defines the text document within tags to structure the web pages. This language annotates text so that machines can understand and manipulate it accordingly. 
     HTML is human-readable and uses tags to define what manipulation has to be done on the text.</pre>
